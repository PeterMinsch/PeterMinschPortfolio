            <spane>
            Hello, I'm Peter Minsch, a hardworking and passionate computer <br/>
            science student on a journey to thrive in the tech industry. <br/>
            It's always been my dream to work alongside professionals <br/>
            who share my passion for computer science! <br/> <br/>

            Currently I am a full-time student and I work as a computer<br/>
            science tutor, where I've been honing my skills in Object-<br/>
            Oriented Programming, Data Structures, C++, C, Java, Linux<br/>
            and Python. This role has not only strengthened my technical<br/>
            abilities but also cultivated essential soft skills such as <br/>
            mentoring, communication, and project management. <br/><br/>
            Outside of school and work, you'll often find me inside my <br/>
            home doing personal coding projects or tackling LeetCode <br/>
            problems. I also like to stay home watching movies and T.V. <br/>
            shows with my family. My friends and family are a big part <br/>
            of my life. <br/><br/>

            As someone who likes to learn new things, I aspire to <br/>
            be a software developer and continue my computer science<br/>
            journey. <br/><br/>

            If you want to speak with me or learn more info then feel <br/>
            free to reach out to me!
